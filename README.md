<pre>
/*--- WWDC 2013 STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP APP ---*/

//The main Catalyst class. Catalyst was created by Julian "insanj" Weiss
//with help from Matt Weiss (testing and inspiration) and Stefan Mitev
//(graphical design). Made in just a few days, Catalyst is meant to represent
//an integration of my curiosity and interest with music and rhythm, and
//how it can go hand-in-hand with user interaction and programming. The
//overt simpliciy of Catalyst is meant to provoke creativity and imagination
//in the user. I hope that no future revisions of this app shake that
//mission statement. It's going to be incredible to see the different types
//of compositions that people make: from noise repeaters to vocal works
//to instrumental mixing to live song mashups.

### app store description

> A chaotic musical instrument for iOS. Catalyst will change the way you think about your iDevice.

> Record your voice, your surroundings, or even your favorite songs onto Beatballs that play whenever they hit the edges of your device. Fling them at (near) light-speed, at a tortoise's pace, or to the rhythm of your favorite song to create personalized, infinitely-long compositions. Change the speed coefficients and decelerations of the balls, or the individual sizes, to make ridiculous tracks that you'll want to play for hours.

> Emulate your favorite video game, create a symphony, or even put together live mash-ups of pop songs. The stage is setâ€” are you ready to pick up the baton?
